This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.\r\n* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.\r\n\r\n## For developers\r\n\r\nNot ready yet.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Joel Larsson.
